# Graduation_Project_MOVIE_GENRE_DETECTION-_SYSTEM_
Predicting movie genre by the poster using deep learning technique


<h3> MOTIVATION</h3>
As we know that watching movies is part of human life and that technology has become necessary in all things, we decided to develop a system that allows the user to know the appropriate classification of films by analyzing images. And to enable the user to the quick search process and ease of access. 

<h3 >PROBLEM STATEMENT </h3>
Many people are attracted to a poster, but when he finishes watching the movie, he puts a bad rating because he does not have enough information about the type of film or the appropriate age. This is very important information before choosing a movie in the movie theater or when purchasing a movie.
<h3> PROJECT OBJECTIVES</h3>

 Design a method that simulates artificial intelligence to reveal movie information.
* Add a new search method for movies.
* Motivate people with technology and artificial intelligence to help them facilitate standard research methods into smart methods.
<h3> PROJECT SCOPE </h3> 
The scope will be in movies’ world. When the project is completed, it will be able to provide an accurate, modern and easy way to search for films.
<h3> SUGGESTED SOLUTION </h3>
In this project, the movie genre detection system we will doing a system to Identify posters films, getting information and offering by application for users. We propose a method supported by a CNN architecture to classify movie image according to their genres, CNNs are the new method for image classification, using concepts from image processing to ensure some degree of position, scale, and distortion invariance. Our contributions in this project is to make available a movies image dataset, which includes more than 8000 images that belong to one of the following genres: action, comedy, horror, or drama ...etc.
To construct this system, the software python is used to write the code and MYSQL database to build the images of our system.
<h3> PROJECT CONTRIBUTION </h3>
1-	We proposed a system that can detect the film from photo.
2-	The system will not be limited and focus only on the photo, we plan to add more objects like age rate and kind of the film.
3-	Taking in consideration the new films, so there will be a permanent update of the system.
4-	The possibility of developing this project in the future and using it with developments around us.
<h3> PROJECT LIMITATION </h3>
•	We will focus on the images, and how to make the machine recognize it.
•	We got data that contains 8000 images for different movies.
•	We will focus on the posters of movies just
